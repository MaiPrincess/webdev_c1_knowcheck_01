                ¡Hola! My name is Theresa Rice, and I am a passionate Mexican woman with a heart full of creativity and a love for traditional crafts. Allow me to share a little about myself and my many interests!
            </p>
            
            <h3>Cooking and Baking</h3>
            <p>
                Cooking and baking have always been a significant part of my life. Drawing inspiration from the rich culinary heritage of Mexico, I delight in preparing authentic dishes bursting with flavor and color. From savory tamales to indulgent tres leches cake, I pour my love into every recipe, infusing each dish with the warmth and spice of my cultural roots.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Sewing and Crafting</h3>
            <p>
                With nimble fingers and a keen eye for detail, I find joy in the art of sewing and crafting. Whether it's stitching vibrant patterns into traditional Mexican textiles or fashioning intricate designs onto handmade garments, I take pride in preserving and celebrating our cultural heritage through the textile arts.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Handcrafted Soaps, Candles, and Wax Melts</h3>
            <p>
                As a maker of cold-processed soaps, candles, and wax melts, I embrace the beauty of natural ingredients and the artistry of scent. Each handcrafted creation is a labor of love, carefully curated to evoke memories, soothe the senses, and bring a touch of luxury to everyday life.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Nourishing Body Butter</h3>
            <p>
                Drawing inspiration from the bountiful gifts of nature, I craft nourishing body butter infused with indigenous botanicals and traditional remedies. These decadent formulations are designed to pamper the skin, leaving it soft, supple, and radiant with health.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Photography</h3>
            <p>
                Capturing the beauty of the world through the lens of my camera is another passion of mine. Whether it's documenting the vibrant colors of a bustling mercado or the serene landscapes of the Mexican countryside, I seek to preserve moments of beauty and joy in every photograph.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In all that I do, I am fueled by a deep appreciation for my Mexican heritage and a desire to share its richness with the world. Join me on this journey as I continue to explore, create, and celebrate the vibrant tapestry of Mexican culture!
            </p>
